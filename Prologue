Prologue
This research presents a Spoofing Detection System that combines Behavioural Analysis with Deep Fake Technology to discern between genuine and manipulated facial presentations, specifically focusing on face liveness detection. In response to the rising concerns associated with deep fake videos (www.youtube.com, n.d.), this project investigates the integration of behavioural analysis and advanced deep fake technologies for robust liveness detection. The study delves into the incorporation of behavioural patterns and head pose information for enhanced detection accuracy. Behavioural analysis techniques are employed to discern subtle behavioural cues associated with genuine facial expressions, contributing to the discrimination between real and synthetic representations. The creation and evaluation of multiple classifiers, each tailored to address distinct detection challenges. The findings underscore the viability of integrating behavioural analysis with deep fake technologies for discerning authentic facial presentations. Comparative analyses between these classifiers reveal the potential of identity embeddings as a fundamental component for reliable deep fake detection. Additionally, the research elucidates the effectiveness of temporal analysis in identifying certain types of deep fake manipulations. However, including head pose information does not exhibit significant improvements in detection performance.
