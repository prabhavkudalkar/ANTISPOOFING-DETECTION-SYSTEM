This project aims to develop a robust Spoofing Detection system using Behavioural Analysis with deep fake technology.
➢
The goal is to create a system that can recognise and distinguish between deep fake-generated facial expressions and real facial expressions.
➢
The scope will encompass the integration of behavioural analysis techniques with deep fake detection algorithms to enhance the overall security measures in facial recognition system.
➢
The project will also make suggestions for upcoming improvements and developments in the areas of spoofing detection and biometric security.
