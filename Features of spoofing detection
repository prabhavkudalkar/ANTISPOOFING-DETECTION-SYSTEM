Real-Time Detection: Advancements have been made in real-time spoofing detection systems, enabling quicker and more immediate identification of fake content. This is particularly useful in applications where rapid detection is crucial, such as in video streaming or live broadcasts. A method for identifying fake, edited videos, more notably ones in which the faces have been changed. I considered four different types of alteration videos: FaceSwap, Deep Fakes, Face2Face, and Neutral Textures (Ciftci and Demir, 2019).
Despite the advances made in this area, there is still a significant vacuum in the literature, particularly when it comes to the direct use of facial recognition architectures for the distinction between real and fake movies. This absence in the literature highlights the need for a more thorough and holistic approach that takes into account the difficulties and complexities involved with spotting modified content within the larger narrative of a film. The proposed architecture presented in this study tries to fill this gap by analysing and evaluating the facial expressions and visual information presented throughout a movie, thereby differentiating between real and fake video segments. According to what has been said, the detection pipeline entails a complex procedure of frame extraction, face image detection, and subsequent classification using a deep neural network (Albazony et al., 2023).
This suggested pipeline combines important elements of current approaches with cutting-edge methods designed to address the unique problems deep fake videos integrated into in-depth movie narratives provide. The other approach, the sequential strategy focuses on looking at a run of related frames in the video. With the help of

this method, you may review temporal data and determine whether the content of the video is consistent across successive frames. The sequential model can assess motion and consistency across time because the frames are successive, which gives it insights that the frame-based model would not be able to.
The video data must be pre-processed to make sure it is formatted correctly before using the following method. The video is split into shorter video clips that still include the face, and these clips are then loaded into the sequential model as a stack of successive frames, producing a single prediction for a given set of frames. The technique of facial recognition has a wide range of uses. These encompass everything from safeguarding private information and restricting access to mobile devices to stepping up surveillance in public areas for law enforcement and public safety. According to (RÃ¶ssler et al., 2019), facial recognition has sped up identity verification procedures, streamlined business processes across several industries, and increased the overall effectiveness of security standards.
